# MyLittlePonyArchiveList
Just a text file in a certain format so I can archive massive amounts of data in the form of BRONY channels.


Format,
For YouTube USER urls,
USERNAME|URL


Example:


SoaringFlight|https://www.youtube.com/user/SoaringFlight


For YouTube CHANNEL urls,
USERNAME_CHANNELID|URL
Example:
````AstrokeFromMe_UCwf-nuBJHeIuPbNinkRH9jA|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwf-nuBJHeIuPbNinkRH9jA````

USER urls are prefered over CHANNEL urls.
